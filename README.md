# Netflix-Clone-
This is a Netflix Clone project that mimics the basic user interface of Netflix, 
including responsive design elements, navigation, and feature sections. 
The primary goal of this project is to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills and to get familiar with building visually engaging and responsive front-end applications.
